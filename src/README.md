## Purpose of Website
The idea of this portfolio is to demonstate a set of skills that has been aquired throughout the course and portray that for future clients/employers. I wanted to keep the website simple and easily navigated. The links in the top keep it so that each page can be accessed from another and always find a way back to another directory.

## Functionality and Features
 I wanted to include as many features as I could that time permitted. The mentioned links were the first I added as I realised that different sections needed to be linked and easily accessible. I also added an email submission form on the contact page alongside links to social medias. By doing this I increased odds of a potential employer reaching out as it may be something that is needed if the employer cannot reach out over Linkedin. The blog has links to each individual blog post. I added this as a "See More" link so that it was readable and enticed the viewer to continue reading. The website is comprised of 4 "main" pages and 5 blog posts on the blog page. The pages are:
 * Home: A page with no scrolling, just to be a quick stop and introduction. The navigation bar at the top is present on all pages. When button links are hovered they turn into a ruby red colour.
 * About: I wrote a brief summary of my life so far for a personal touch. At the bottom of the page is a link to download my resume for potential employers.
 * Blog: This pages hosts the 5 blog posts. I kept the text of each preview short so that the viewer may click in to read more. I chose an indigo colour for the background as I felt the colours were suiting.
 * Blog Post: These pages are sample blogs, each still with a navbar to find a way back to the rest of the websites content.
 * Contact: On the contact page I put links to social media and an email submission form for prospective employers.

## Target Audience

The target audience for the portfolio is any potential employer/client for future projects.
